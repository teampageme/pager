We decided to bring the pager back through an android app.\r\n\r\n# How does this app work?\r\n\r\nWhen starting up the app the user is prompted to create a new account or log in with an existing account. \r\nEach user has a unique 9-digit number generated for them which is used as their pager number.\r\nAfter logging in the user is brought to the main activity called the paging activity where they can dial a pager number they wish to message.\r\nA dial is used to input each of the 9 digits of the receiver’s number.\r\nAfter dialing the number, the user is sent to the compose message activity.\r\nTo keep the app as similar to a pager as possible, a message can only consist of numbers.\r\nAfter composing, the message is sent to the server and the user is put back at the main page.\r\nReceived messages can be read by pressing the mail button on the pager activity.\r\nIn the messages activity, all messages are retrieved from the server and displayed for the user.\r\nPager settings can be accessed by pressing the gear icon on the main page.\r\n\r\n#\tDevelopment\r\n* \tUI is made with XML in Android Studio\r\n* \tBackend made with LNMP (Linux + Nginx + Maria DB + PHP 7) stack.\r\n* \tFuture works may include features like (needs to be filled later)\r\n",
