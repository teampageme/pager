#	Description

### What this app is?
We are making an android app that emulates a pager. 
### 	Who the target audience is?
we designed the app in mind that our main audience would be those who grew up in the late 1900’s who have used a pager. 
We also designed it in mind of those who have no idea what a pager is and through our app can experience it for themselves what using a pager would be like. 
###	How it benefits users?
The pager is a device that has been forgotten as cell phones became popular. We decided to bring the pager back through an android app.

# How does this app work?

When starting up the app the user is prompted to create a new account or log in with an existing account. 
Each user has a unique 9-digit number generated for them which is used as their pager number.
After logging in the user is brought to the main activity called the paging activity where they can dial a pager number they wish to message.
A dial is used to input each of the 9 digits of the receiver’s number.
After dialing the number, the user is sent to the compose message activity.
To keep the app as similar to a pager as possible, a message can only consist of numbers.
After composing, the message is sent to the server and the user is put back at the main page.
Received messages can be read by pressing the mail button on the pager activity.
In the messages activity, all messages are retrieved from the server and displayed for the user.
Pager settings can be accessed by pressing the gear icon on the main page.
